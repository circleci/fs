About
=====
This library tries to provide Clojure code for handling the file system.

It has most of the functionality found in `java.io.File`_ influenced by Python's
`os.path`_ and `shutil`_.

.. _`java.io.File`: http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/File.html
.. _`os.path`: http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html
.. _`shutil`: http://docs.python.org/library/shutil.html
